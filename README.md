# CA273-Visualisation

### A repository containing some visualisation I made as part of my assessment for my Data Processing and Visualisation module.
### For some context, we were asked to create a visualisation about something interesting we found in the datasets given. These were datasets of pedestrian counts on certain streets in Dublin City Centre for 2008, 2010 and 2019.

##### Please find below links to the Jupyter notebook used to make them and the GIFs themselves.
